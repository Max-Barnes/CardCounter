# CardCounter

This program is intended to be a blackjack simulator that can maintain the count of the deck. It will take multiple decks, players and can shuffle as the user wants. Will run in the command line at first. Primarily a java application
also will have tips for new players on how to understand the game.
maybe leaderboard in the future? 

No plans to come back to this project unless as a full application.
